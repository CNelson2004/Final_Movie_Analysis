## Executive Summary

`_TODO: Provide a concise overview of the project objectives, key findings, and actionable recommendations._`
Project Objectives: 
identify the best movies or hiest revinue movies 

Key Findings:
none of the analasises done show anyting statisticly significant when put in refrenc to the Questins though there are some small difrences in move revinue depending on the season and other facters.

Actionable Recommendations:
Becaus there are no significant facters more analasis is highly advised. we segjest seporating data (seporating it in to season movie type and other difrences) more for deaper analasisi this would hopefully reduce the vareation. the other idea for beter analasis is to identify the high earning revinue movies and find what they have in common and use that to see what could influence revinue.
the analasis did not show any statisticly significant data but some actions that might indicate a quality movie or improve revinue are
1)
2)
3)

## Project Context

`_TODO: Describe the motivation, stakeholders, and success criteria for this analysis._`
Motivation:
we want to know what movies have the hiest revinue and see what could help maximise the revinue of a movie. all this with the belife that revinue for movies is an indicater of how good a movie is. 

Success Criteria:
the goal is to identify the best indicaters of a movie and ether use them to maxamise revinue or identify the best movies from them.

Stakeholders:
this project has 2 intorested partys. one is indeviduals who want to enjoy a good movie and not pay for low quality entertainment, and the secnd is companies who want to maxamise the amount of revinue they earn with as little loss as posable.

## Data Sources

- _Primary dataset:_ 
* List of movies: [Universal Movies from 2020-2029](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Pictures_films_(2020%E2%80%932029)) and [Universal Movies from 2010-2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Pictures_films_(2010%E2%80%932019))
* Financial Data for movies: [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
- _Supplementary data:_ These were the only sites used `TODO - describe any external references`
- _Data access notes:_ Wait five seconds between requests, all information is open access with no licenses needed `TODO - mention licenses or refresh cadence`

## Methodology

1. _Data acquisition:_ Used common web scraping techniques to obtain data from Wikipedia and The Numbers. Specifically the libraries: requests and beautiful soup. `TODO - outline collection scripts/APIs`

2. _Cleaning pipeline:_ `TODO - summarize transformations and validations implemented`
* Separated Release Date into Year and Month, and used month to create a new column called Season
* Changed all revenue numbers from strings containing $ to proper integers. 
* Changed runtime from a string to an integer 
* Changed all None values to np.Nan
* Removed all extraneous information, specifically 
- Who released the movie and what type of release it was (for both video and theater release date)
- Percentage of total gross for opening weekend
- Production budget as related to worldwide box office
- MPAA Rating specifics
* Created a profits column by taking Total Box Office Revenue - Budget
* A separated .csv was created for Machine Learning Analysis wherein the target, Total Box Office Revenue, was analyzed as a log of the original target due to the skewness of the target data 

3. _Analysis workflow:_ 
* correlate all the data to see what has an effect on income
* find the NAs for reference
* plot the money against one another to check for anomalies
* find the average revenue for each year and then plot it for clearer visuals
* find the statistics for some of the means
* plot the categorical data with regards to the Inflation Adjusted Domestic Revenue

"We used some basic analysis such as  correlation, plots to visualize it (mostly line plots but some box plots for categorical data). This required only a few changes such as adding a column for year or doing basic math, mostly wit dates, to get usable numbers for plots and correlation. There are some NAs in the data set, around 60 to 70 for each column. The highest one was 146 but that was Franchise which wasn't really used in any analysis"

4. _Tooling:_ `TODO - list packages, environments, and reproducibility steps`
* Packages: The packages used were: 
- bs4
- ipykernel
- lxml
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- requests
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- shap
- streamlit
- twine
- quarto
* Environments: The virtual environment UV was used for htis project 
* Reproducibility Steps: Run the functions in order as given in the Tutorial

## Results & Diagnostics

`_TODO: Summarize the main metrics, charts, or model diagnostics produced. Include links to figures or tables once available._`
Main Metrics:
the main metrics for the plots and data of importance are as fallowes
    genaral move revinue:
        mean = 9.1 e^7
        sd = 1. e^8
    season of releas:
        spring has the hiest revinue (there isnt a significant difrence between any except for summer and fall summer is beter (0.011))
        fall:   mean =  5.5 e^7,    sd = 7.17 e^7
        winter: mean =  7.9 e^7,    sd = 7.62 e^7
        spring: mean =  9.3 e^8,    sd = 1.3 e^8
        summer: mean =  1.493 e^8,  sd = 1.8 e^8

    Genra:
        the hiest means are in 'Musicals', 'Action', 'Adventuer' with means and sd of
        Musicals: mean = 1.6 e^8 ,sd = 1.8 e^8
        Action:   mean = 1.9 e^8 ,sd = 2.18 e^8
        Adventuer:mean = 1.88 e^8,sd = 1.78 e^8

    Movie Rating:
        PG: mean = 1.2 e^8 ,sd = 1.5 e^8
        R: mean = 5.5 e^7  ,sd = 6.4 e^7

    Production Method:
        Anamation/ Live Actin: mean = 1.58 e^8 ,sd = 1.68 e^8
        Digital Animation:     mean = 2.1 e^8  ,sd = 1.7 e^8

## Discussion & Next Steps

`_TODO: Interpret the results, note limitations, and capture open questions or future experiments._`
Results:

Limitations:
the catigorical and numarical analasis for coralation cant show causeation so we dont know if ajusting one will directly influence the other. whats more is that none of the resolts shown significance, this means that the vareance of revinue in any of our analasises is not difrent form the avrage mean.

Open Questions:
1) if you seporate things further

Future Experiments:
inorder to reduce the amount of vareance it would be smart to seporte data more an exsample might be only action movies in winter compared to adventuer movies in winter. this would hopefully reduec the vareance and creat a more acurate analsis aswll as show any influence between vareables for exsample if R movies earning less revinue because most of them where relesed in winter. an analasis of movie ratings for these movies would also be informative as to what watchers value and there for what you could charge more for.
