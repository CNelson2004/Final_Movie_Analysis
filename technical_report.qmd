## Data Sources

- _Primary dataset:_ 
* List of movies: [Universal Movies from 2020-2029](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Pictures_films_(2020%E2%80%932029)) and [Universal Movies from 2010-2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Pictures_films_(2010%E2%80%932019))
* Financial Data for movies: [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
- _Supplementary data:_ These were the only sites used `TODO - describe any external references`
- _Data access notes:_ Wait five seconds between requests, all information is open access with no licenses needed `TODO - mention licenses or refresh cadence`

## Methodology

1. _Data acquisition:_ Used common web scraping techniques to obtain data from Wikipedia and The Numbers. Specifically the libraries: requests and beautiful soup. `TODO - outline collection scripts/APIs`

2. _Cleaning pipeline:_ `TODO - summarize transformations and validations implemented`
* Separated Release Date into Year and Month, and used month to create a new column called Season
* Changed all revenue numbers from strings containing $ to proper integers. 
* Changed runtime from a string to an integer 
* Changed all None values to np.Nan
* Removed all extraneous information, specifically 
- Who released the movie and what type of release it was (for both video and theater release date)
- Percentage of total gross for opening weekend
- Production budget as related to worldwide box office
- MPAA Rating specifics
* Created a profits column by taking Total Box Office Revenue - Budget
* A separated .csv was created for Machine Learning Analysis wherein the target, Total Box Office Revenue, was analyzed as a log of the original target due to the skewness of the target data 

3. _Analysis workflow:_ 
* correlate all the data to see what has an effect on income
* find the NAs for reference
* plot the money against one another to check for anomalies
* find the average revenue for each year and then plot it for clearer visuals
* find the statistics for some of the means
* plot the categorical data with regards to the Inflation Adjusted Domestic Revenue
"We used some basic analysis such as  correlation, plots to visualize it (mostly line plots but some box plots for categorical data). This required only a few changes such as adding a column for year or doing basic math, mostly wit dates, to get usable numbers for plots and correlation. There are some NAs in the data set, around 60 to 70 for each column. The highest one was 146 but that was Franchise which wasn't really used in any analysis"

4. _Tooling:_ `TODO - list packages, environments, and reproducibility steps`
* Packages: The packages used were: 
- bs4
- ipykernel
- lxml
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- requests
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- shap
- streamlit
- twine
- quarto
* Environments: The virtual environment UV was used for htis project 
* Reproducibility Steps: Run the functions in order as given in the Tutorial
