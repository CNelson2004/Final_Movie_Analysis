## Executive Summary

*Project Objectives:* 
Identify the highest revenue movies by finding what features determine high grossing movies. In other words, how would I make a movie, and when would I release it in order to return the highest amount of revenue?

*Key Findings:*
None of the analyses done show anything statistically significant results when put in reference to the questions, though there are some small differences in movie revenue depending on various factors, (such as Season and Genre), these factors are not mentioned specifically since they are statistically irrelevant.

*Actionable Recommendations:*
Because there are no significant factors, more analysis is highly advised to reduce uncertainty. We suggest separating data (such as into season, movie type, etc) for a deeper analysis, which likely reduce the variation. Additionally, analysis identifying the high earning revenue movies and finding what they have in common could be used to see what influences revenue.
The analysis did not show any statistically significant data, but some actions that might indicate a high revenue movie is a movie that appeals to everyone, is released in the summer, and has a high starting budget. Making a PG movie using Digital Animation in the genre of Adventure or Action, which appeals to those inside and outside the US, is anticipated to result in higher overall revenue.

## Project Context

*Motivation:*
We want to know what movies have the highest revenue and see what could help maximize the revenue of a movie. Please note that this is with the belief that revenue for movies is an indicator of how good a movie is. 

*Success Criteria:*
Identify distinct features that have the greatest impact on overall movie revenue and what degree that impact is.

*Stakeholders:*
This project has two interested parties. One is individuals who want to enjoy a good movie and do not want to pay for low quality entertainment, and the second is companies, (Business/Board of Trustees/Boss), who want to maximize the amount of revenue they earn when creating a movie.

## Data Sources

- *Primary dataset:* 
    * [Universal Movies from 2020-2029](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Pictures_films_(2020%E2%80%932029)) and [Universal Movies from 2010-2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Universal_Pictures_films_(2010%E2%80%932019))
    * Financial Data for movies: [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/)
- *Supplementary data:* The primary dataset were the only sites/sources used, there was no supplementary data
- *Data access notes:* Wait five seconds between requests, otherwise all information is open access with no licenses needed

## Methodology

1. *Data acquisition:* Used common web scraping techniques to obtain data from Wikipedia and The Numbers using the libraries: requests, beautiful soup, regex, and pandas. Specifically, our function `data_creation` uses the init function for both requests and beautiful soup, `read_html` from pandas, `sub`, `match` from regex, `get` from requests, and `find` from beautiful soup. 

2. *Cleaning pipeline:*
* Note: The following were all done using basic methods from pandas and regex
* Changed Release Date from a string into a datetime object
* Changed all revenue numbers from strings containing $ to proper integers
* Changed runtime from a string to an integer 
* Changed all None values to np.Nan
* Removed all extraneous information, specifically 
    - Which company released the movie and what type of release it was (for both video and theater release date)
    - Percentage of total gross for opening weekend as compared to total revenue
    - Production budget as related to worldwide box office
    - MPAA Rating specifics (Ex: for violence, swearing, etc)
* Created a profits column by taking Total Box Office Revenue - Budget
* Also created a Year, Month, and Season column from the release date
* This was validated by checking that all columns were of specified types and manually viewing the dataset, and all was as expected
* A separated csv was created for Machine Learning Analysis wherein the target, Total Box Office Revenue, was analyzed as a log of the original target due to the skewness of the target data, this separate csv, `ml_movie_data.csv`, also removes all non-numeric columns
* `ml_movie_data.csv` is the transformed version of `movie_data.csv`
* This was validated by checking the new transformed column and csv as a whole


3. *Analysis workflow:*
* Correlate all the data to see what has an effect on income using panda's `corr`
* Find the NAs for reference panda's `isna`
* Plot the revenue against one another to check for anomalies using panda's `plot`
* Find the average revenue for each year and then plot it for clearer visuals using panda's `plot` (accentuated with matplotlib features such as `legend` and `title`)
* Find the statistics for some of the means using panda's `describe`
* Plot the categorical data with regards to the Total Box Office Revenue using pandas's `boxplot` (accentuated with matplotlib)
* Find the significance of the features with pingouin's `pairwise_gameshowell` and scipy's `f_oneway`
* Find the impact of the features in regards to predicting Total Box Office Revenue using shap's `shap_values` and `summary_plot` in regards to a Random Forest Model trained on the data using `ml_movie_data.csv`

We used some basic analysis such as  correlation, along with plots to visualize it (mostly line plots but some box plots for categorical data). This required only a few changes such as adding a column for year or doing basic math, mostly with dates, to get usable numbers for plots and correlation. There are some NAs in the data set, around 60 to 70 for each column. The highest one was 146 but that was Franchise which wasn't really used in any analysis.

4. *Tooling:*
* Packages: The packages used were: 
    - bs4
    - lxml
    - matplotlib
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - requests
    - scikit-learn
    - shap
* Environments: The virtual environment UV was used for this project with Python 3.13. 
* Reproducibility Steps: Run `totality()` to reproduce our dataset, results, and interpretation, for more details see the [tutorial](tutorial.qmd)

*Model Diagnostics:* 
We chose not to create a prediction model because no statistically significant variables were identified, and thus have no model diagnostics. 

## Discussion & Next Steps

*Results:*
There were no statistically significant variables because the variance was so high. There are some factors that appear to have some influence such as season of release, genre, and rating, (R, PG, G), but further analysis could reveal more influence if variance was reduced.Additionally, from our ML analysis, it seems as though international revenue has the highest effect on predicting the overall gross revenue. This isn't interesting in and of itself, but comparing it to how little effect the domestic revenue has is interesting, as it tells us how much the international audience matters to the success of a movie compared to the domestic (US) audience.

*Limitations:*
The categorical and numerical analysis for correlation can't show causation so we don't know if adjusting one will directly influence the other. Additionally, none of the results shown significance, this means that the variance of revenue in any of our analyses is not different from the average mean.

*Open Questions:*
1. If you separate the features further (year of production, season of production, genre, etc.) does it tell a clearer story about the data?
2. Are movie ratings related to the revenue earned for that movie?
3. Are there other factors that influence revenue? (such as storyline, plot twists, etc)
4. Do outliers, (very high or very low revenue movies), have common features?

*Future Experiments:*
In order to reduce the amount of variance it would be smart to separate data more, an example might be only action movies in winter compared to adventure movies in winter. This would hopefully reduce the variance and create a more accurate analysis as well as show any influence between variables, for example if R movies earning less revenue because most of them were released in winter, then an analysis of movie ratings for these movies would be informative as to what watchers value and therefore what you could charge more for.
