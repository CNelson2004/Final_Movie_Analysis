In other words, how would I make a movie, and when would I release it in order to return the highest amount of revenue?\nKey Findings: In total, we found that making a movie that appeals to everyone, is released in the summer, and has a high starting budget, results in the highest revenue. Specifically, making a PG movie using Digital Animation in the genre of Adventure or Action, which appeals to those inside and outside the US will result in the highest overall revenue. This movie should be made with the largest production budget possible, (to get the best talent), and should be released in the summer, specifically on whatever weekend has the best chance of creating the highest opening weekend revenue possible.\nActionable Recommendations: Create a movie as described in the Key Findings above."

This required only a few changes such as adding a column for year or doing basic math, mostly wit dates, to get usable numbers for plots and correlation. There are some NAs in the data set, around 60 to 70 for each column. The highest one was 146 but that was Franchise which wasn’t really used in any analysis”\n\nTooling:\n\n\nPackages: The packages used were:\nbs4\nipykernel\nlxml\nmatplotlib\nnumpy\npandas\nrequests\nscikit-learn\nshap\nEnvironments: The virtual environment UV was used for this project with Python 3.13.\nReproducibility Steps: Run totality() to reproduce our dataset, results, and interpretation, for more details see the tutorial"

Additionally, none of the results shown significance, this means that the variance of revenue in any of our analyses is not different form the average mean.\nOpen Questions:\nFuture Experiments: In order to reduce the amount of variance it would be smart to separate data more, an example might be only action movies in winter compared to adventure movies in winter. This would hopefully reduce the variance and create a more accurate analysis as well as show any influence between variables, for example if R movies earning less revenue because most of them were released in winter. An analysis of movie ratings for these movies would also be informative as to what watchers value and there for what you could charge more for."
