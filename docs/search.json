We suggest separating data (separating it in to season, movie type, and other differences) more for deeper analysis this would hopefully reduce the variation. The other idea for better analysis is to identify the high earning revenue movies and find what they have in common and use that to see what could influence revenue. The analysis did not show any statistically significant data but some actions that might indicate a quality movie or improve revenue are making a movie that appeals to everyone, and releasing in the summer, with a high starting budget, could results in the higher revenue. Making a PG movie using Digital Animation in the genre of Adventure or Action, which appeals to those inside and outside the US is anticipated to result in higher overall revenue."

All this with the belief that revenue for movies is an indicator of how good a movie is.\nSuccess Criteria: Identify distinct features that are important for overall movie revenue.\nStakeholders: This project has 2 interested parties. One is individuals who want to enjoy a good movie and not pay for low quality entertainment, and the second is companies (Business/Board of Trustees/Boss) who want to maximize the amount of revenue they earn with as little loss as possible."

This required only a few changes such as adding a column for year or doing basic math, mostly wit dates, to get usable numbers for plots and correlation. There are some NAs in the data set, around 60 to 70 for each column. The highest one was 146 but that was Franchise which wasn’t really used in any analysis”\n\nTooling:\n\n\nPackages: The packages used were:\n\nbs4\nipykernel\nlxml\nmatplotlib\nnumpy\npandas\nrequests\nscikit-learn\nshap\n\nEnvironments: The virtual environment UV was used for this project with Python 3.13.\nReproducibility Steps: Run totality() to reproduce our dataset, results, and interpretation, for more details see the tutorial"

Additionally, none of the results shown significance, this means that the variance of revenue in any of our analyses is not different form the average mean.\nOpen Questions: 1. if you separate things further\nFuture Experiments: In order to reduce the amount of variance it would be smart to separate data more, an example might be only action movies in winter compared to adventure movies in winter. This would hopefully reduce the variance and create a more accurate analysis as well as show any influence between variables, for example if R movies earning less revenue because most of them were released in winter. An analysis of movie ratings for these movies would also be informative as to what watchers value and there for what you could charge more for."

factors_findings\nfactors_findings()\n\nProduct Budget is most strongly correlated with international earnings, this implies that the high earning movies had the most funding (on average)\nSummer is the time for big box office hits.\nAlthough PG and R may have similar medians, PG often outperforms R movies.\nMusicals have the highest median revenue, but Action has a far larger range, and has a greater number of movies with higher revenues, similar statements can be said about Adventure\nDigital animation seems to do the best on average, I presume this is because it appeals to a wide range of people, although Live Action is also very capable of doing well.\nRegarding significance, there is only true statistical significance between Summer and Fall in Seasons, and PG and R in Ratings\nOverall, it seems that making movies that appeal to everyone, thus PG with a genre of Adventure, Action, or Musical, with a high budget and releasing it in the summer is the best chance for making a high earning movie\n\n\n\nfrom final_movie_analysis import revenue_findings\nrevenue_findings()\n\nIt seems Universal has done fairly well during this time period before 2019.\nHowever, this was only a misstep, although a costly one, as they have reached back into their pre-2019 revenue range\n\n\nIf you would like to do these analyses individually, then you can use these following

ml_analysis_findings\nml_analysis_findings()\n\nRegarding the shap graphs, which were made based on a Random Forest Model, red refers to high values and blue is low values.\nClustering shows the impact of that feature. If there is clustering near 0, then little impact is had from that feature. Spread out means large impact on target feature, and if there is clustering to the left or right, it shows skewness.\nBased upon the graphs, it seems that before a movie opens, the budget is the best predictor of revenue, bigger budget likely means bigger revenue, in both positive and negative directions.\nAfter a movie has had its opening weekend, those opening weekend numbers are the best for determining overall revenue, and those values are skewed toward the positive side.\nAfter a movie has released, then using its international revenue, (which is skewed right), is a good way to predict overall revenue, this tells us international contributes far more than domestic revenue to overall revenue.\nThus appealing to people outside of the US is important, as much as if not more so than appealing to people within the US. I believe this is due to the fact that international as a whole is a larger population than just the US population.\n\n\nFinally, taking everything together, you can see what we found from the data in regards to our specific research question:\n\nfrom final_movie_analysis import do_analysis_specific\ndo_analysis_specific()\n\nOur research question is: What features of a movie have the most influence and which contribute most to a high revenue?

0.080193  \nOur general findings were:\n\nProduct Budget is most strongly correlated with international earnings, this implies that the high earning movies had the most funding (on average)\nSummer is the time for big box office hits.\nAlthough PG and R may have similar medians, PG often outperforms R movies.\nMusicals have the highest median revenue, but Action has a far larger range, and has a greater number of movies with higher revenues, similar statements can be said about Adventure\nDigital animation seems to do the best on average, I presume this is because it appeals to a wide range of people, although Live Action is also very capable of doing well.\nRegarding significance, there is only true statistical significance between Summer and Fall in Seasons, and PG and R in Ratings\nOverall, it seems that making movies that appeal to everyone, thus PG with a genre of Adventure, Action, or Musical, with a high budget and releasing it in the summer is the best chance for making a high earning movie\n\nThe following is our machine learning analysis:\nMost important features before a movie opens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost important features right after a movie opens\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost important features long after a movie opened\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur general findings were:\n\nRegarding the shap graphs, which were made based on a Random Forest Model, red refers to high values and blue is low values.\nClustering shows the impact of that feature. If there is clustering near 0, then little impact is had from that feature. Spread out means large impact on target feature, and if there is clustering to the left or right, it shows skewness.\nBased upon the graphs, it seems that before a movie opens, the budget is the best predictor of revenue, bigger budget likely means bigger revenue, in both positive and negative directions.\nAfter a movie has had its opening weekend, those opening weekend numbers are the best for determining overall revenue, and those values are skewed toward the positive side.\nAfter a movie has released, then using its international revenue, (which is skewed right), is a good way to predict overall revenue, this tells us international contributes far more than domestic revenue to overall revenue.\nThus appealing to people outside of the US is important, as much as if not more so than appealing to people within the US. I believe this is due to the fact that international as a whole is a larger population than just the US population.\n\nAfter our analysis, our end answer is: The features with the most influence on the end total box office revenue change depending on whether the movie has come out and for how long.\nIf it has been out awhile, then its international revenue, if it just came out, its the opening weekend numbers, if it hasn't come out, then its the production budget.\nIf you want better odds at making a high revenue movie, then make an Adventure, Action, or Musical Movie using Digital Animation.\nMake sure it is PG and that you release it in the summer.\nYou should also begin with as large a production budget as possible, make sure it appeals to those outside as well as inside the US, and choose the best weekend in the Summer to release it for the best opening weekend revenue possible.\n\n\nIf you would like to do these all at the same time, data gathering, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation, then you can use the totality function: (This is the only function that does not require that you run data_creation prior to running it.)\n\nfrom final_movie_analysis import totality\n#Note, since this include data_creation this will take up to 2 hours, depending on your machine speed, copy and uncomment to run yourself\n#totality()"
