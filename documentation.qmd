Functions:
`data_creation()`
This function requires no parameters.
This function creates a new dataset from scratch by scraping the web, specifically the websites of wikipedia and the-numbers.
It saves a pandas dataframe of this dirty data as a csv under the title 'dirty_data.csv'. Then it takes the dataframe and cleans the data.
It also adds the new columns Season and Profit. It saves this new clean pandas dataframe as a csv under the title 'movie_data.csv'.


`do_analysis_all()`
This function requires no parameters. However, `data_creation` must be ran before this function can be used since it requires 'movie_data.csv'.
This function performs all the analyses functions as described above. 


`findings()`
This function requires no parameters. However, `data_creation` must be ran before this function can be used since it requires 'movie_data.csv'.
This function prints our findings and interpretation of the data from `do_analysis_all`.


`do_ml_analysis_plots()`
This function requires no parameters. However, `data_creation` must be ran before this function can be used since it requires 'movie_data.csv'.
This function utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically the library shap, to create plots demonstrating the significance of various features during different stages of a movie's release. 


`do_ml_analysis_numbers()`
This function requires no parameters. However, `data_creation` must be ran before this function can be used since it requires 'movie_data.csv'.
This function utilizes machine learning techniques to create return numbers demonstrating the significance of various features during different stages of a movie's release. 


`ml_analysis_findings()`
This function requires no parameters. However, `data_creation` must be ran before this function can be used since it requires 'movie_data.csv'.
This function returns our findings and interpretation of the data from `do_ml_analysis_plots` and `do_ml_analysis_numbers`.


`do_analysis_specific()`
This function requires no parameters. However, `data_creation` must be ran before this function can be used since it requires 'movie_data.csv'.
This function states our research question, and utilizes `do_analysis_all()`, `findings`, `do_ml_analysis_numbers()`, `do_ml_analysis_plots()`, and `ml_analysis_findings()`, to provide an answer to that question. All of this is printed out into the terminal.


`totality()`
This function requires no parameters. However, `data_creation` must be ran before this function can be used since it requires 'movie_data.csv'.
This function gathers, cleans, analyzes, and interprets the data. Specifically is performs the functions of `data_creation` and `do_analysis_specific` at the same time.
