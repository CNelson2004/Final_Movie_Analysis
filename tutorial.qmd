Here is how to use this package.

Note: None of these functions have any parameters, however, some of them need to be ran in a specific order, as will be discussed.

First, obtain the data. This function creates the dirty dataset, saves it as an csv, `dirty_data.csv` then cleans it and saves it as a csv, `movie_data.csv`. 
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import data_creation
#Note, this will take up to 2 hours, depending on your machine speed, it returns nothing, copy and uncomment to run yourself
#data_creation()
```

**Please know that none of the following functions will work unless you have run `data_creation`, thus creating a csv for these functions to work with.**

If you would like to simply see the first few rows of the dataset, run this function:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import print_dataset_head
print_dataset_head()
```

These are the analysis functions.
Analysis related to the factors:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import analyze_revenue
analyze_revenue()
```

Analysis related to the revenue over time:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import factors_analysis
factors_analysis()
```

You can also print the findings that we found from analyzing this data:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import factors_findings
factors_findings()
```

```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import revenue_findings
revenue_findings()
```

If you would like to do these analyses individually, then you can use these following functions.

Here you can get the number of NAs from each column:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import get_NAs
get_NAs()
```

Get the correlation between the features:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import earnings_correlation
earnings_correlation()
```

Get the graph regarding seasons and revenue:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import season_earnings
season_earnings()
```

Get the graph regarding genre and revenue:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import genre_earnings
genre_earnings()
```

Get the graph regarding production method and revenue:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import production_method_earnings
production_method_earnings()
```

Get the graph regarding ratings and revenue:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import ratings_earnings
ratings_earnings()
```

If you would like to see the statistical significance of various features, then use these functions:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import season_significance
season_significance()
```

```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import rating_significance
rating_significance()
```

```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import genre_significance
genre_significance()
```

```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import production_method_significance
production_method_significance()
```

If you would like a statistical description of the revenue features, run this like so:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import describe_revenue
describe_revenue()
```

If you would like a graph of the revenue, run this:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import graph_revenue
graph_revenue()
```

If you would like to simplify that to each year, run this:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import graph_revenue_by_year
graph_revenue_by_year()
```

If you would like to check the above graph against profit, run this function like so:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import graph_revenue_and_profit
graph_revenue_and_profit()
```

Now, you can do analysis regarding feature importance in finding overall box office revenue
If you only want plots:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import do_ml_analysis_plots
do_ml_analysis_plots()
```

If you want specific numbers:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import do_ml_analysis_numbers
do_ml_analysis_numbers()
```

Again, you can print the findings that we found from analyzing this data:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import ml_analysis_findings
ml_analysis_findings()
```

Finally, taking everything together, you can see what we found from the data in regards to our specific research question:
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import do_analysis_specific
do_analysis_specific()
```

If you would like to do these all at the same time, data gathering, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation, then you can use the `totality` function: (This is the only function that does not require that you run `data_creation` prior to running it.)
```{python}
from final_movie_analysis import totality
#Note, since this include data_creation this will take up to 2 hours, depending on your machine speed, copy and uncomment to run yourself
#totality()
```
